{asciidoctor-html} is a simple static site generator
that converts a set of https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] files into an HTML website. It extends the default
HTML converter provided by {asciidoctor-org} to make it easy for lecturers to write
and publish notes or short technical monographs online.

The best way to learn how to use {asciidoctor-html} is by reading these docs and looking at the
https://github.com/ravirajani/asciidoctor-html/tree/main/docs/asciidoc[source files] from which they were generated.

In addition to https://github.com/ravirajani/asciidoctor-html/blob/main/Gemfile[gems from the Ruby ecosystem],
this software makes use of the following indispensible open source libraries.
